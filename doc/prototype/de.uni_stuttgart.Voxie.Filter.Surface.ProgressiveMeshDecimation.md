## Description

Progressive Mesh Decimation is used to reduce the complexity of the Mesh.
Step by step it removes some of the edges to simplify the mesh model.
To see how exactly the Progressive Mesh Decimation filter is calculated, show the source code.

Based on:

## Parameters

The following list details which parameters are used by the filter.

### Minimum angle of feature edges

Minimum angle value ($`\alpha_f`$)

### Fraction of Vertices to be eliminated

Fraction of Vertices value
