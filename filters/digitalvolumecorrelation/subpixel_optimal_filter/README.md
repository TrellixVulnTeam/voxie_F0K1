This implementation of subpixel registration by finding an optimal filter is based on the paper:

D. G. Bailey et al., "Bias of higher order predictive interpolation for sub-pixel registration", 2007 6th International Conference on Information, Communications & Signal Processing, 2007, <doi:10.1109/icics.2007.4449703>
